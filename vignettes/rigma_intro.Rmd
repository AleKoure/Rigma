# Getting started

An account in Figma can be accessed using the API and a personal access token.

Make your own access token:

- Open your Figma account and log in.

- From the top-left menu in Figma, select Account Settings.

- Locate the section on personal access tokens.

- Select New Token by clicking.

- There will be a token created. This will be your last opportunity to copy the 
token, so be careful to store a copy of it safely.

When you retrieve the personal access token save it as an environmental 
variable (e.g. edit `.Renviron` by typing `usethis::edir_r_environ()`).

```
FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE!!!"
```

After saving your changes restart R session.

## Example

Open Figma and navigate to your favorite file. In the URL you can see the key
of the file. To retrieve the File as an R object execute:

```
library(Rigma)
example_file_key <- "sFHgQh9dL6369o5wrZHmdR"
get_file(example_file_key)
```

A tree of nodes is used to represent the Figma file. Every file has a DOCUMENT 
node at the root, and any CANVAS nodes branch out of that node. Various POST
and GET methods are provided in this package to interact with a Figma files and
teams.
