Description: The goal of Rigma is to provide a user friendly client to the
    'Figma' API <https://www.figma.com/developers/api>. It uses the latest
    `httr2` for a stable interface with the REST API. More than 20 methods
    are provided to interact with 'Figma' files, and teams. Get design
    data into R by reading published components and styles, converting and
    downloading images, getting access to the full 'Figma' file as a
    hierarchical data structure, and much more. Enhance your creativity
    and streamline the application development by automating the
    extraction, transformation, and loading of design data to your
    applications and 'HTML' documents.
