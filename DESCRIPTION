Description: The goal of Rigma is to provide a user friendly client to the 'Figma'
 API <https://www.figma.com/developers/api>. It uses the latest `httr2` for a 
 stable interface with the REST API. More than 20 methods are provided to 
 interact with 'Figma' files, and teams. Get design data into R by reading 
 published components and styles, converting and downloading images, getting 
 access to the full 'Figma' file as a hierarchical data structure, and much 
 more. Enhance your creativity and streamline the application development by
 automating the extraction, transformation, and loading of design data to your 
 applications and 'HTML' documents.
