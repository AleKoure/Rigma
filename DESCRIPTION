Title: Access to the Figma API via R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alexandros Kouretsis
Maintainer: Alexandros Kouretsis <alexandros@appsilon.com>
Description: The Figma API allows for interactions and read access to Figma 
 files. This enables you to inspect any objects or layers, as well as their 
 properties, and extract them so you may render them as images outside of Figma. 
 Then you can present your designs, extract design data that can be used for 
 Shiny and Rmarkdown, integrate them with other systems, or use them to realize
 your original ideas.
